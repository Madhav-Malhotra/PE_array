# Processing Element Array

This is a work in progress where I improve upon an array of processing elements created in Verilog. 
The aim is to add features that make the processing element array suitable for running multiply-accumulate (MAC) computations for ML accelerators in particular. Examples of features to add include sparsity optimisation and supporting multiple floating point precisions.
